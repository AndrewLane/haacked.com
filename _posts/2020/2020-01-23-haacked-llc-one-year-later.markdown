I always saw burnout as something that happened to other people. It's not that I didn't believe burnout was real, I know it's real. There's plenty of evidence for that. As a manager, I've helped people create the space and conditions to recover from burnout.

The reason I saw it as affecting other people is I had the mistaken belief that the way I approached work prevented _me_ from burning out. This is a problematic belief because it caused me to ignore all the warning signs and address it early.

## The Causes of Burnout

In retrospect, I was burnt out near the end of my tenure at GitHub. And because of my problematic belief, I didn't realize it until long after I left. I wasn't working long hours. In fact, the last few months were not very busy at all during the "quiet" phase of the acquisition by Microsoft. But it's a misconception that burnout is only associated with overwork and long hours.

While long hours can contribute to it, from my experience that often isn't the primary factor. [This Forbes post](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/05/13/the-6-causes-of-professional-burnout-and-how-to-avoid-them/) notes six causes of burnout...

1. Lack of control
2. Insufficient Reward
3. Lack of Community
4. Absence of Fairness
5. Conflict in Values
6. Work Overload

Viewed through that lens, it became clear to me that I was indeed dealing with burnout.

## Starting Haacked LLC

One way to address burnout is start your own business. This notion may seem ridiculous because starting a business is notorious for work overload. But it doesn't have to be if you're consulting and willing to manage your client base well.

And working for yourself addresses many of the other burnout causes. For example, with your own business, you are in control. You may not be in control of the overall market conditions, etc., but you are in control for how you will respond to any given situation.

Absence of Fairness is addressed because ostensibly, you're fair to yourself unless you're some kind of masochist. But then you have other problems.

Conflict in Values is addressed because you have the power to run your business according to your own values.

This is why [I started Haacked LLC](https://haacked.com/archive/2019/01/07/haacked-llc/) with high hopes and a smile. And I was off to a good start with a couple solid clients. I made decent money over the year without putting too many hours in.

## Burnout paper cuts

But as I mentioned before, I jumped right back into work without an understanding of burnout and its causes. And it started to catch up to me.

I loved working with my clients, but there were a lot of papercuts that nagged on me. Stupid things that shouldn't be a problem were amplified in my own head. For example, I might have a call with a client at a set time once a week. Only once a week should be easy. But when the time came, I dreaded the interruption to whatever I may have been doing at the time. I was having trouble dealing with _anything_ on my schedule. It seems ridiculous, but that was the state of my head.

Along with that, I was putting pressure on myself to blog regularly and build up my social media presence so I could ward away the specter of irrelevance and maybe attract more customers. This is entirely self-inflicted, but it caused me to actually shut down and withdraw from all such activities.

I started to write code to build a product. That really boosted my mood for a while. I really missed writing code in earnest. I spent four years at Microsoft as a program manager so any code I wrote was politely sent to the recycling bin and rewritten by a competent developer. I was hired at GitHub as a developer, but not long after I became a manager and director. I enjoy software leadership as well as writing code, and leading a small company is one way to do both.

But even writing code started to wear thin. As this Harvard Business Review article notes, [Burnout at Work Isn’t Just About Exhaustion. It’s Also About Loneliness](https://hbr.org/2017/06/burnout-at-work-isnt-just-about-exhaustion-its-also-about-loneliness).

I loved building something new, but I miss the camraderie of building something with other people. There's nobody there to bounce ideas off of at key indecision points. While rubber ducky debugging can be effective, the rubber ducky isn't a great work companion. It doesn't share any funny memes or tell any good jokes.

## What I'm Doing in 2020

Now that I understand what's going on, I can do something about it. As the great philosopher GI Joe once remarked...

![Parody image of GI Joe telling kids "Remember kids, knowing is half the battle...the other half is extreme violence."](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/72928987-d4116380-3d0d-11ea-98eb-27f99414e6b4.png)

I have the extreme privilege to be able to take some time off and do absolutely nothing. It's what I should have done when I left GitHub. I planned a trip to recharge my batteries and after that, I hope to visit some friends. Cultivating friendships is something I've not been very good at.

To be fair, doing nothing is not the right description. What I'm focused on is exploring things I want to do and avoiding as much work out of obligation as possible. Obviously I can't avoid all my obligations, nor do I want to. With two home-schooled kids, I have plenty on my plate with obligations to them that I cherish.

What's different is I will blog when the mood takes me and not feel like I have to blog. I'll embrace irrelevance. I'll write code when I feel like it and not feel pressured to make progress on my product. And I may even take a customer this year if it interests me, but not because I feel I have to. The type of gigs I'm more interested in are those that are not open-ended. A week on-site in an interesting location means more fun travel for me.
