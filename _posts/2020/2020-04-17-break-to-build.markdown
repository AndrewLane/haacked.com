Marc Andreessen wrote a recent _cri de cœur_ to start [building to solve the biggest problems we have](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/).

> There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems — we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.

And I agree with this point. Let's create a system where talented people have the means and incentive to solve our most pressing challenges.

> I expect this essay to be the target of criticism.

Oh, you think?!

> Here’s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There’s an excellent chance I’ll agree with you.

False dichotomy there. Why not both? This is diversionary tactic. It assumes that the reader agrees with the premise. The premise is misleading and disingenuous. It provides a shallow look at what holds back building today.

I hope to demonstrate that, before I share my ideas on what to build. You see, there's a few things we need to break, before we can really unleash the potential of all the talent we have in America to build.

## Bad Premises

> Many of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or another, on one government or another.

This glosses over accountability. I'm not naive to believe that any of our existing political parties would have been fully prepared, but it defies credulity to think that the current response is what we could expect from any party.

Obama warned about [the need for bipartisan preparation](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/04/10/barack-obama-2014-pandemic-comments-sot-ctn-vpx.cnn) for a pandemic six years ago! Whereas our current president [gutted the nation’s infectious disease defense infrastructure](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/) and continually [downplayed the pandemic as it grew](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/20/how-donald-trump-responded-coronavirus-pandemic/). He's still at it with recent tweets to "Liberate" states from lockdown.

This is not meant to be a partisan argument. Hell, I think the Dubya  administration would have handled it better.

My point is politics do play a big role in our response to a pandemic. I'm not sure a private industry response could mobilize the resources needed to address future pandemics. It requires a governmental response because viruses do not care about state lines or corporate boundaries. So who we choose to put in government matters.

> The problem is regulatory capture.

Regulatory capture may be a problem in some areas, but this is picking lint off a shit covered shirt. It doesn't address the deeper problems that prevent building. So let's dig into that. What do we need to break first?

## 1. Break that healthcare is tied to employment

For millions of Americans today, their healthcare is tied to their employment status. As we've seen, this isn't a resilient system amidst a pandemic as [unemployment soars](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/unemployment-soars-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-81040965777).

Starting [a new company is financially risky](https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail). For those who have medical conditions (or care for those who do), it can be life threatening. Universal healthcare would eliminate this worry and allow more people to take the risk and build.

## 2. Break the idea that higher education is a privilege.

> Why not educate every 18 year old?

This is an area where I agree with Andreessen. But he doesn't offer much in the way of solutions. I'm a fan of Elizabeth Warren's [idea to eliminate student debt and make college free](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/23/elizabeth-warren-proposes-free-college-and-eliminating-student-debt.html).

You want a nation of builders, educate them and make them free of the shackles of student loan debt. Suddenly you've enabled a large number of people to take more risks and build something new rather than to go work at their _safe_ choice so they can pay down their student debt.

## 3. Break the idea that access to clean water, healthy food, and shelter is a privilege.

How can people start to build when they don't have access to basic needs? This requires that we push our governments to invest in basic infrastructure. Universal Basic Income is one interesting area of investigation. If people's basic needs are covered, they can afford to build.

## 4. Break the current political system.

The two-party system in America leaves us with all or nothing politics and milquetoast candidates. I would think those on the other end of the political spectrum would want this too! After all, I know many conservatives who feel the current president doesn't speak for them, but will end up voting for him because there's no other choice. Likewise for me, Biden is a disappointing candidate who doesn't represent many of the positions I care about. I will vote for him because he's less dangerous than the other candidate.

The point here is not which candidate is better. The point is many of us on the right and left agree that we're stuck in a catch 22. If you vote for candidates that actually represent your interests, your vote may be wasted or worse, help elect the opposition under our current system.

Let's push for a better approach such as [ranked choice voting](https://time.com/5718941/ranked-choice-voting/)!

If you believe in letting the best ideas win, then ranked choice voting is for you.

Ranked choice voting allows you to vote for the candidate and ideas that best represent you. It frees people from choosing the most “electable” candidate or "winnable" idea without fear of throwing away their vote. It does this by allowing you to rank your choices in order of precedence. That way if the candidate you most want doesn't win, your second place will. It doesn't de-facto go to the opposition.

And even if your first choice doesn't win, it can have a positive effect if many people also voted for that choice. It sends the message to the winners that whatever they were about is important to a lot of people. It can change the national conversation much in the way Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have. But it changes the conversation in a way with teeth.

There's a few other things we need to break while we're in there fucking things up.

### Break the oligarchy.

In this, Andreessen and I seem to agree.

> The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation

So how do we do this? Well one place to start is to [overturn Citizen's United](https://www.citizen.org/article/frequently-asked-questions/) which gives corporations outsized influence on politics.

On top of that, we need to... 

### Break the barriers to voting

In 2016, [61.4 percent of the citizen voting-age population reported voting](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html) in the presidential election. In that election, the winner received 62,984,828 votes. The loser received 65,853,514 votes. That means our president was elected by about 28% of the voting population. (Yes, I could go on a rant about the breaking the Electoral college too, but first thing's first.)

No matter where you are on the political spectrum, if we want to choose the best candidates so the best ideas can win, we need to have more than 28% of our population choose our president. Especially if we had ranked choice voting in the mix.

Mail in voting is probably the best idea we have to break down barriers to voting. It removes many of the traditional impediments such as voter intimidation, lack of access to polls, etc.

## Conclusion

Going back to the original post, I'm all about having our best and brightest working on our hardest problem. I believe the post is looking at the wrong barriers.

If we break the current impediments I mentioned here, I think we'd see a huge explosion of people with the desire to build and solve these problems unleashed. I think this would benefit both those on the right and on the left.

So what can you and I do?

Well, if you have the means, go ahead and build! My point is not to suggest that you shouldn't respond to the rallying cry if you can.

My point is to also look deeply at what's holding back so many others from responding and work to address those problems. Contact your legislators and make it clear there's a demand for change! Keep working towards that change. Donate to causes that are working towards these changes.
