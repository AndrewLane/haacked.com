But what if you want to stay in your area of expertise and be promoted. This is why IC tracks are important.

But what if you already are a manager. Do you eventually cap out?

Certainly rates of promotion slow down, but that's just as much an issue of scarcity. There's less room at the top.

Assuming people always reach their level of incompetence reflects a static mindset. A growth mindset would imply the person isn't fully compentent in the new role yet, but will get there.

The question is, if an organization promotes a person, can the organization support them?
