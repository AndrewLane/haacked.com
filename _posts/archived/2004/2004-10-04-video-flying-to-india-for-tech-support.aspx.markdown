This is a [hilarious video](http://methodshop.com/tech/articles/conan/)
from the Conan O'Brien show.

> What happens when you need a personal touch to your computer problem
> and your tech support department is in India? Most people would just
> call a tech support hotline, but not comedy writer Andy Blitz. He
> decides to fly to India with his computer and get it fixed in person.

Watch and find out.
