Key points.

1. Sometimes it's faster to make the change yourself than to describe the change you want.
2. You might not have access to make the change directly. In that case, you have to fork the entire repository.
3. You can describe the exact change in text, but now they have to properly cut and paste it into the right place. Hopefully they don't make a mistake. Especially if whitespace is important (looking at you Pytho).
4. Wouldn't it be nice if you could suggest the exact change you want and they could resolve it with a click?
5. Good news, there is!
