If you're part of a distributed group, it can be difficult to organize activities and drive towards your goals. It might be that you're group is a team within a company, an open source project, or even an open source foundation. I was in such a situation recently. I lamented that our progress was slow going. We were using email to discuss topics and organize amongst ourselves. Email is a terrible tool for this purpose. So much so, we _weren't_ sending emails to each other.

So I convinced everyone to give [the team discussions feature on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-team-discussions) a try. Many of these folks were longtime GitHub users, yet they had no idea this feature existed. I don't blame them of course. The feature is only available if you're a member of an [organization on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-organizations).

If you're an administrator of an org, you can go to the Teams page to see the list of teams in your org. The URL is always `https://github.com/orgs/ORG-NAME/teams` where you obviously replace "ORG-NAME" with the actual name of the organization.

Click on a team name to navigate to the team discussion page. The format of the URL for the team discussion page is: `https://github.com/orgs/ORG-NAME/teams/TEAM-NAME`

When you start a discussion, you can specify if it should be public to the entire org or private to the specific team.

When I was running the Client Apps team at GitHub, I would post a weekly "newsletter" as a team discussion for my entire team. I called it the CACAW which stood for Completely Awesome Client Apps Weekly. This was a way that I could relay important information I thought my team should know, give kudos for successes within the group, and solicit feedback on what I had been working on and what I see as our priorities. It was my way of keeping the team informed and aligned. That's just one possible use for team discussions.

Team Discussions work a lot like issues. So when do you start a discussion vs an issue. In general, if there's a...

Discussions that span repos and don't belong in any one repository's issues.
