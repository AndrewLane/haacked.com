I have a lot of ideas I want to get out of my head so they can see the light of day. Many of them will be bad ideas. But every once in a while, one of those ideas might make a mark on someone. Someone out there will have an even better take on the idea. That person might take that ember of an idea and make a conflagration out of it.

![I am a writer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/58360174-1cede100-7e3c-11e9-89ba-b0d9e876b1c6.jpg)

But I haven't been very good about writing often. I attributed it to writer's block, but that's a cop out. I realized that when Seth Godin called me out in his podcast, [No Such Thing (As Writer's Block)](https://www.akimbo.me/blog/episode-4-no-such-thing-as-writer-s-block). Ok, he wasn't calling me out specifically. He has no idea who I am. But it sure felt like he made that post for me.

He's also written about [this idea on his blog](https://seths.blog/2012/12/writers-block-and-the-drip/).

> Consider the alternative to writer's block: the drip. A post, day after day, week after week, 400 times a year, 4000 times a decade. When you commit to writing regularly, the stakes for each thing you write go down.

Because I blog so infrequently, my expectations of each blog post continue to go up. It has to be perfect. It has to be unnassailable. It has to withstand every and all criticism. These are impossible goals!

Not only that, by not writing more often, my progress as a writer is slower. The more I write, the better I'll get. Sure I'll write a ton of crap, but every now and them, a gem will appear.

So I plan to make a commitment to write every day. Will I _publish_ every day? Well, this brings me to another realization I had while reading [Nadia Eghbal's post on GitHub Sponsors](https://nadiaeghbal.com/github-sponsors).

There's a paragraph that talks about why people follow other people on GitHub.

> If I ask why, I tend to hear a few common responses: 1) they’re learning a specific skill, and watching that person is helpful, or 2) they’re experienced developers who just love being able to see how “the best” do it.

I'm not so conceited to think I'm one of "the best" when it comes to writing, but it does occur to me that the way I blog is very different from the way I write code when using GitHub.

A long time ago, I [migrated my blog to GitHub Pages](https://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/). This means I write my posts in markdown and commit them to a Git repository with the idea in mind that I'd use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to write my posts.

But in practice, I'd commit locally and only push to the repository when I was ready to publish. Why would I work this way? It doesn't reflect my real writing process. It doesn't give room for feedback from anyone who might be interested in how I shape my ideas?

For the most part, it's fear. Fear of exposing my raw ideas and having them taken out of context before I've had time to polish them. But two things occur to me:

1. Most people don't read my blog. And of those that do, most are not going to look at my repository. They'll wait for the published piece if they plan to read it at all.
2. My writing would be better if I expose it earlier and give those who are interested a chance to chime in before I publish the post. This will be a tiny number of people (perhaps 0), but if I get even one person to make a PR comment, I benefit.

So I'm going to try and make a commitment to write and push to GitHub every day. Much of what I write will be half-baked hand-wavey in progress ideas. But if you're into that sort of thing, I'd definitely appreciate the feedback and [give credit](https://haacked.com/contributors/) where it's due.
